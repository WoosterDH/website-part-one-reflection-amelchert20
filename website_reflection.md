# Website Reflection Prompt

Please write for me ~200 words reflecting on the following:
  * What is the story that you set out to tell with your website and how did you have to make decisions along the way to achieve that vision?
  * Where did you find challenges in this assignment?
  * How did you challenge yourself?
  * In what aspects do you take particular pride?

This will be considered as part of the evaluation for the first part of the Website project.

**I am trying to tell the story of my diverse talents in a simple, resume-ish website. I want it to be accessible to older generations and yet beautiful enough to appeal to my generation. It could be used to professionally let my peers know more about me or be a part of a job application. I want the design to be neat and fit onto one scrolling page. The different sections should look individual to separate my talents or skills so that the website feels like a thorough platform to project who I am. Learning all the new things that I can add to a website was a challenge. I added new sections and font awesome icons, as well as pictures, a video, and text.  I attempted to add an automatically-playing audio file and a list, but have encountered serious problems to work through in the html and css files. I will challenge myself by sorting through more code to solve these problems and make the site both easier to use and more attractive. Moving forwards, I’d like to manipulate the color scheme and streamline the cite.**
