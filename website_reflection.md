# Website Reflection Prompt

Please write for me ~200 words reflecting on the following:
  * What is the story that you set out to tell with your website and how did you have to make decisions along the way to achieve that vision?
  * Where did you find challenges in this assignment?
  * How did you challenge yourself?
  * In what aspects do you take particular pride?

This will be considered as part of the evaluation for the first part of the Website project.

**I am trying to tell the story of my diverse talents in a simple, ~~resume-ish~~ resume-like website. I want it to be accessible to older generations and yet beautiful enough to appeal to my generation. It could be used ~~to~~ professionally to let my peers know more about me or be a part of a job application. I want the design to be neat and fit onto one scrolling page. The different sections should look individual to separate my talents or skills so that the website feels like a thorough platform to project who I am. \[insert new paragraph here?\] Learning all the new things that I can add to a website was a challenge. I added new sections and font awesome icons, as well as pictures, a video, and text.  I attempted to add an automatically-playing audio file and a list, but have encountered serious problems to work through in the html and css files. I will challenge myself by sorting through more code to solve these problems and make the site both easier to use and more attractive. Moving ~~forwards~~ forward, I’d like to manipulate the color scheme and streamline the ~~cite~~ site.**

> It's very clear that you were challenging yourself and that you took the project seriously. It's great, too, that you have a clear story that you're able to articulate, even if the site _on its own_ doesn't make that story as clear. "Learning all the new things" that you could put into your site is a great outcome and part of the process of this assignment; if one tries to _implement_ all of those things, though, the site might distract, sensorially, from the story that you want to tell. (Adding an audio file, for example, might be a bit much.) Going forward let's work on the things that you'd like to work on -- build out your skills -- but let's try to bring a more editorial eye to the project. You want to be sure that you hone your story too: what do you want folks to know about your diverse talents? how do you want them to associate this site with you? Just things to think about and build upon as your project grows.
